# Lab03

Using a Genetic Algorithm, we're supposed to solve a black box problem with 1, 2, 5 and 10 instances



# Implemented Solution

Implemented a Genetic Algorithm whitch promotes some randomness in parent selection as well as mutation and recombination.

In parent selection 2 sets of  2 parents get chosen, one of them being the 2 best parents. Then we order the 2 sets and use some randomness in a turnament between them, making sure that the fittest parent has a better chance of winning

The choice between the mutation and recombination is 50:50
